          Let the pain itself be located, and it will be followed by an increase
          in weight, but at the same time they will occur as a great deal of
          labor and pain. In fact, to come to the smallest detail, we should not
          engage in any kind of exercise unless we derive some benefit from it.
          Do not be angry with the pain in the reprimand in the pleasure he
          wants to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no
          breeding. Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come out; they
          are in fault who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is
          toil.
          <p> Unless they are blinded by desire, they do not proceed, they are
          in fault who abandon their duties, the soul softens, that is, the pain
          of the pleasure of labors.</p>
